# Question 1
	
The Java APIs are a lifesaver if you can’t remember what function to use for a datatype. 

* String https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
* Integer(int) https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/lang/Integer.html 
* Scanner https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
* General API Search https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/
* Here are some questions about the API to answer:

1. In the Integer API, what is the difference between hasNextInt() and nextInt()? (Found in Scanner API)
	* hasNextInt() - Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be interpreted as an int value
	* nextInt() - Scans the next token of the input as an int
2. If you were working with a different version of Java (say 7), what is the easiest way to reach the API for that version?
	* Go to https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/index.html and select the version you want.
3. In the Integer API, what function would be used to gather an int from a String?
	* parseInt(String s)
4. In the String API, what functions are named the same as C++?
	* length()
	* replace()
5. In the General API, is there a Severity class?
	* Yes
6. In the String API, what functions are used to compare other Strings?
	* compareTo(String anotherString)
	* compareToIgnoreCase(String str)
		
					
# Question 2
	
Download, unzip and import the code found here:

1. What are Java’s primitive types?
	* Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. There are 8: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double.
2. Are Java’s primitive types pass by value or reference?
	* Pass by value
3. Are Java’s String types pass by value or reference?
	* Pass by value
4. Are Java’s Array types pass by value or reference?			
	* Pass by reference

# Question 6
	
There has been a very nice addition (somewhat recently) to Java called StringBuilder. 
What are the differences between String and StringBuilder? (you need to list a few differences)
